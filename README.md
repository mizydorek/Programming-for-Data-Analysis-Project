# Programming for Data Analysis

Repository for the project for the Programming for Data Analysis module @ GMIT - 2020

#### Project Overview

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project you should:

• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.

• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section gives an example project idea.

#### Contents of repository

The repository contains:

* `README.md` file
* `project.ipynb` — jupyter notebook contains solution to the assignment
* `requirements.txt` — contains list of packages need to run the notebook
* `.gitignore` — contains list of files that have to be ignore
* `ProgDAProject.pdf` — contains project overview and requirements
* `heart.csv` — Heart Failure dataset

#### Required software

The following software is required to run the notebook:

* `git` — open source software to download the repository onto computer[3]
* `python` — Python Programming Language
* `Numpy. Matplotlib. Seaborn. Jupyter. Pandas. SciPy` — python packages used to make an investigation into the numpy.random package[5,6,7] 

The following command will install the packages according to the configuration file

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or alternatively 

* `Anaconda` — Individual edition of Anaconda can be install to get all of the relevant software.[4]

#### Instructions for downloading repository

At github repository [Programming for Data Analysis](https://github.com/mizydorek/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project) click on the green `Code` button to copy the link. Open command line(windows) or terminal(osx/linux), navigate to the selected directory and enter the command `git clone` folowed copied the URL. Alternatively copy the whole command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/mizydorek/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project.git
```

The whole repository will be cloned down onto current working directory.

#### How to run the jupyter notebook

From there run `jupyter notebook` command on the command line/terminal. This will open Jupyter in the browser. The notebook containing solution that is called `numpy.random.ipynb` can be opened by clicking on it.
Once opened, select `Restart and Run All` from Kernel sub-menu to run the jupyter notebook.

#### Viewing the Notebook 

The notebook can be viewed online either on the [github](https://github.com/mizydorek/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/main/project.ipynb) or by accessing through Jupyter Notebooks viewer  [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mizydorek/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/main/project.ipynb).
